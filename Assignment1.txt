14.How is memory managed in Python?
        Memory is managed in python by Garbage Collector 
        Garbage Collection is a process in which the interpreter frees  up the memory when not 
        use to make it available for other objects. Assume a case where no reference is pointing 
        to an object in memory, the virtual machine has a garbage collector that automatically 
        deletes that object from the heap memory.
        If two or more variables that have the same value, so, what Python virtual machine
        does is , rather than creating another object of the same value in the private heap,
        It actually makes the second variable point to that originally existing value in the 
        private heap.
        
15.How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?
        We can easily add Python to Windows path by downloading a recent version of 
        Python , and then checking the box to Add Python to Path at the bottom of the setup
        screen.


16.Is Indentation required in python?
        Yes
